I'm with Niel
-------------

requires wu.js I have it packaged for meteor too. should be in my github.

Tyson uses function composition and content type declaration to create universal

THIS IS NOT READY FOR REAL APPLICATIONS! WORK IN PROGRESS!

I am doing lots of thinking about how this will all work. Take a look at thoughts.org for a fairly unorganized account of my thinking.
