*** path composition
**** modularize path function composition
     Right now the tag renderThisPage composes functions based on the url. Thoes 
     functions are found on the pathHandlers object. I would like to be able to 
     reuse the composition function for new renderThisX style tags 
     (renderThisMenu for example) in order to be able to modularize the different
     page elements.
